# SEP Guidelines

- This document is heavily based on the [MCP SEP process](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/community/sep-guidelines), adapted for ACP.

> Specification Enhancement Proposal (SEP) guidelines for proposing changes to the Agentic Commerce Protocol

## What is a SEP?

SEP stands for Specification Enhancement Proposal. A SEP is a design document providing
information to the ACP community, or describing a new feature for the Agentic Commerce
Protocol or its processes or environment. The SEP should provide a concise technical
specification of the feature and a rationale for the feature.
We intend SEPs to be the primary mechanisms for proposing major new features, for collecting
community input on an issue, and for documenting the design decisions that have gone into
ACP. The SEP author is responsible for building consensus within the community and
documenting dissenting opinions.
Because the SEPs are maintained as text files in a versioned repository (GitHub Issues), their
revision history is the historical record of the feature proposal.

## What qualifies a SEP?

The goal is to reserve the SEP process for changes that are substantial enough to require broad
community discussion, a formal design document, and a historical record of the decision-making
process. A regular GitHub issue or pull request is often more appropriate for smaller, more
direct changes.
Consider proposing a SEP if your change involves any of the following:

- **A New Feature or Protocol Change**: Any change that adds, modifies, or removes features
  in the Agentic Commerce Protocol. This includes:
- Adding new API endpoints or methods.
- Changing the syntax or semantics of existing data structures or messages.
- Introducing a new standard for interoperability between different ACP-compatible tools.
- Significant changes to how the specification itself is defined, presented, or validated.
- **A Breaking Change**: Any change that is not backwards-compatible.
- **A Change to Governance or Process**: Any proposal that alters the project's decision-
  making, contribution guidelines (like this document itself).
- **A Complex or Controversial Topic**: If a change is likely to have multiple valid solutions or
  generate significant debate, the SEP process provides the necessary framework to explore
  alternatives, document the rationale, and build community consensus before implementation
  begins.

## SEP Types

ACP recognizes **two kinds of SEPs**:

1. **Major Changes (Require SEPs)** — Any substantial, complex, or controversial change to
   the ACP specification. Examples include:

- Adding, modifying, or removing features in the specification.
- Significant changes to how the specification is defined, presented, or validated.
- Breaking changes that are not backwards-compatible.
- Complex or controversial protocol topics requiring community discussion.

2. **Process Changes (Require SEPs)** — Adjustments to how the project is governed or how
   core processes operate. This includes changes to governance roles, responsibilities,
   decision‑making rules, contributor processes, or any structural revisions to the project itself.

## Submitting a SEP

The SEP process begins with a new idea for the Agentic Commerce Protocol. It is highly
recommended that a single SEP contain a single key proposal or new idea. Small
enhancements or patches often don't need a SEP and can be injected into the ACP
development workflow with a pull request to the ACP repo. The more focused the SEP, the
more successful it tends to be.

Each SEP must have an **SEP author** -- someone who writes the SEP using the style and
format described below, shepherds the discussions in the appropriate forums, and attempts to
build community consensus around the idea. The SEP author should first attempt to ascertain
whether the idea is SEP-able. Posting to the ACP community forums (Discord, GitHub
Discussions) is the best way to go about this.

### SEP Workflow

SEPs should be submitted as a GitHub Issue in the [primary repository](github.com/agentic-
commerce-protocol/agentic-commerce-protocol). The standard SEP workflow is:

1. You, the SEP author, create a well-formatted GitHub Issue with the `SEP` and `proposal`
   tags. The SEP number is the same as the GitHub Issue number, the two can be used
   interchangeably.
2. Find a Founding Maintainer or Maintainer (future tier) to sponsor your proposal. Founding
   Maintainers and Maintainers will regularly go over the list of open proposals to determine which
   proposals to sponsor.&#x20;
3. Once a sponsor is found, the GitHub Issue is assigned to the sponsor. The sponsor will add
   the `draft` tag, ensure the SEP number is in the title, and assign a milestone.
4. The sponsor will informally review the proposal and may request changes based on
   community feedback. When ready for formal review, the sponsor will add the `in-review` tag.
5. After the `in-review` tag is added, the SEP enters formal review by the Founding Maintainers
   team. The SEP may be accepted, rejected, or returned for revision.
6. If the SEP has not found a sponsor within three months, Founding Maintainers may close the
   SEP as `dormant`.

### SEP Format

Each SEP should have the following parts:

1. **Preamble** -- A short descriptive title, the names and contact info for each author, the
   current status.
2. **Abstract** -- A short (~200 word) description of the technical / process issue being
   addressed.
3. **Motivation** -- The motivation should clearly explain why the existing protocol specification
   is inadequate to address the problem that the SEP solves. The motivation is critical for SEPs
   that want to change the Agentic Commerce Protocol. SEP submissions without sufficient
   motivation may be rejected outright.
4. **Specification** -- The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of
   any new protocol feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing,
   interoperable implementations. A PR with the changes to the specification should be provided.
5. **Rationale** -- The rationale explains why particular design decisions were made. It should
   describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale should provide
   evidence of consensus within the community and discuss important objections or concerns
   raised during discussion.
6. **Backward Compatibility** -- All SEPs that introduce backward incompatibilities must include
   a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The SEP must explain how the
   author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities.
7. **Reference Implementation** -- The reference implementation must be completed before
   any SEP is given status "Final", but it need not be completed before the SEP is accepted. While
   there is merit to the approach of reaching consensus on the specification and rationale before
   writing code, the principle of "rough consensus and running code" is still useful when it comes to
   resolving many discussions of protocol details.
8. **Security Implications** -- If there are security concerns in relation to the SEP, those
   concerns should be explicitly written out to make sure reviewers of the SEP are aware of them.

### SEP States

SEPs can be one one of the following states

- `proposal`: SEP proposal without a sponsor.
- `draft`: SEP proposal with a sponsor.
- `in-review`: SEP proposal ready for review.
- `accepted`: SEP accepted by Founding Maintainers, but still requires final wording and
  reference implementation.
- `rejected`: SEP rejected by Founding Maintainers.
- `withdrawn`: SEP withdrawn.
- `final`: SEP finalized.
- `superseded`: SEP has been replaced by a newer SEP.
- `dormant`: SEP that has not found sponsors and was subsequently closed.

### SEP Review & Resolution

SEPs are reviewed by the ACP Founding Maintainers team on a bi-weekly basis.

For a SEP to be accepted it must meet certain minimum criteria:

- A prototype implementation demonstrating the proposal
- Clear benefit to the ACP ecosystem
- Community support and consensus

Once a SEP has been accepted, the reference implementation must be completed. When the
reference implementation is complete and incorporated into the main source code repository,
the status will be changed to "Final".

A SEP can also be "Rejected" or "Withdrawn". A SEP that is "Withdrawn" may be re-submitted
at a later date.

## Reporting SEP Bugs, or Submitting SEP Updates

How you report a bug, or submit a SEP update depends on several factors, such as the maturity
of the SEP, the preferences of the SEP author, and the nature of your comments. For SEPs not
yet reaching `final` state, it's probably best to send your comments and changes directly to the
SEP author. Once SEP is finalized, you may want to submit corrections as a GitHub comment
on the issue or pull request to the reference implementation.

## Transferring SEP Ownership

It occasionally becomes necessary to transfer ownership of SEPs to a new SEP author. In
general, we'd like to retain the original author as a co-author of the transferred SEP, but that's
really up to the original author. A good reason to transfer ownership is because the original
author no longer has the time or interest in updating it or following through with the SEP
process, or has fallen off the face of the 'net (i.e. is unreachable or not responding to email). A
bad reason to transfer ownership is because you don't agree with the direction of the SEP. We
try to build consensus around a SEP, but if that's not possible, you can always submit a
competing SEP.
