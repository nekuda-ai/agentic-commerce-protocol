### ACP Principles and Mission

#### Mission

The **Agentic Commerce Protocol (ACP)** exists to promote open, secure, and interoperable
commerce between agents, payment providers, and sellers. Our mission is to advance adoption
and real-world use of ACP as a neutral, open standard—one that evolves rapidly alongside the
pace of AI while maintaining trust, safety, and technical integrity.

#### Core Principles

These principles guide the ACP project. They are used by the Stewards to evaluate changes,
resolve disputes, and make directional decisions.

##### 1. Trust, Security and Compliance

ACP’s first responsibility is to ensure that participants can **safely conduct commerce** through
the protocol.
The protocol should help developers build **secure, trustworthy, and compliant systems** that
protect users and maintain confidence across the ecosystem.

##### 2. Built for Real-World Use

The specification is meant to be used. This may seem obvious, but we insist on the user journey
(agents transacting with sellers) to be front and center. Design changes should focus on real,
deployable improvements with clear adoption paths, not theoretical ideas. The protocol should
evolve from actual participant needs, not speculation. Additionally, we recognize that these
commerce flows are complex – we will write high quality documentation and provide testing
tools to ensure confidence in user deployment.

##### 3. Open and Neutral

ACP is **agnostic** to specific agents, payment providers, sellers, transport layers, payment
methods, etc. The specification does not index on any one participant, business model, or
technology. Implementations should build on top of the ACP specification, not the reverse,
ensuring that the protocol remains open, extensible, and adaptable to future innovations. ACP
should also integrate smoothly with other open standards and protocols.

##### 4. Agile

ACP intends to remain agile and rapidly evolve to keep up with frontier model capabilities as
well as the changing needs of participants. We will incorporate feedback and look to find the
right balance between speed, stability and focus to best serve users.
